# Object Detection for Self-Driving Cars

This repository contains code and resources for implementing object detection in the context of self-driving cars. The project explores various techniques, including the sliding window algorithm, CNN-based vehicle recognition, transfer learning with pre-trained models, and the state of the art YOLO model.

## Usage

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
2. Install the required dependencies:
3. Place the input images for object detection in the `data/images/` directory.

4. Run the Jupyter Notebook `notebooks/ObjectDetection.ipynb` to explore and execute the code.

## Project Structure
